# Annotate

Annotate is a Python library that allows you to add type annotations to your code and check them at runtime.

## Why Annotate?

Type annotations are a useful feature of Python that can help you write more readable, maintainable, and bug-free code. However, Python does not enforce type annotations by default, so you may still encounter type errors at runtime. Annotate solves this problem by providing a simple and elegant way to check your type annotations and raise informative exceptions if they are violated.

## Requirements

Annotate requires Python 3.6 or higher and the `typing` module from the standard library.

## Installation

You can install Annotate using pip:

```bash
pip install annotate
